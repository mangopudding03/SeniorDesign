## PROJECT

### What is it?
Fitly is a fitness application that can produce meal plans and exercise routines
based on your goals, ideal weight and build. The main component of the application
that sets it apart from mainstream fitness application is a visual outline of your body
in the main screen to help visualize how exercises targeting those muscle groups
can do if exercised consistently. Alternatively, if a user feels uncomfortable looking
at their body outline, they can either search or utilize the chatbot for exercise
routines and meal plans. The content is curated to avoid misdirection from
mainstream media and if more direction is needed, a chatbot can be utilized. The
chatbot will be built on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to avoid AI
hallucinations and misguidance. The application will also take AI Ethics into
account to avoid being misused and misunderstood by users.

### College Experience
Ever since the beginning of my degree, I’ve always wanted to create an application
that has a personal meaning while also being innovative to talk about with
employers. In my first two years, the classes I took did not dive much deep or had
any projects for me to experiment with web design and application development, so
I took a certification course in Udemy to give me some exposure on basic web
development. Though I knew basic web development, I never had the time or the
right mindset to begin working on my application. However, things changed in my
third year, my database class (CS 4092 – Database Design and Development)
required us to create a full stack shopping application and I used PostgresSQL and
Flask to build it. Working on this project deepened my interest in web development
and I got more exposure to different tech stacks and ways to deploy an application.
My last-minute decision to get a certificate in Web Development from Udemy
turned out to be a highlight in my resume which secured me my first co-op and
became a talking point with future employers about individual initiation. My first co-
op (Fischer Homes, Application Support and Data Analytics Intern) thought all there
is to know about database management and query scripting which solidified my
SQL skills which is crucial in maintaining the database and tying a full stack
application together. In my third co-op (Kroger, Payments Intern), I modified the UI
by updating and simplifying the JSON data from Cosmos DB and this experience
taught me how we can get and send data utilizing API keys and connections which is
going to be beneficial and fundamental in developing my application.

### Motivation
My main motivation for the project stems from my own personal experience with
fitness and eating disorders. I was so overwhelmed with the plethora of resources
and there were so many videos and routines that promoted unhealthy eating habits
which made me feel disgusted when I couldn’t follow through the diet plans.
Through this project, I plan to create a safe space for beginners and fitness
enthusiasts to experiment and incorporating exercise and diet routines safely by
curating safe content while still yielding impressive results. My preliminary
approach is to design my UI so I have a rough idea of how to lay content. I also plan
to interview people to gather user needs/requirements and research competition
and do an analysis of their product and their most prominent components. Lastly, I
will need incorporate unique elements and curated content to fill out my
application.
The resulting product should have a body silhouette feature that imitates your body,
and you can search through exercises for each of the muscle groups. You can also
search meal plans through a filtering system that takes your dietary needs into
account. Additionally, an easier way would be to utilize the chatbot that helps you
navigate your fitness goals and gives you exercise routines and meal plans. I will
know I am done with this app when my testers are able to navigate/use the app and
get the help they wanted without any issues. I will have at least 5 people try it out
and have them look for different tings to create diversity in testing and helps with
early bug detection. I will self-evaluate my contributions by creating a list of
requirements and if they were achieved or not and by having my testers tell me if
this app proved to be of use to them.
